Feature: Collection Invoice Wise API Testing
  As a system user
  I want to test the collection invoice wise endpoint
  So that I can ensure proper functionality and HTML page rendering for collection invoice wise management

  Background:
    Given I set up base URI for transactions
    When I set up request specification
