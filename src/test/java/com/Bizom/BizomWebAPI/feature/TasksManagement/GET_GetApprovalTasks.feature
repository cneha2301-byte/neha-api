Feature: Get Approval Tasks API Testing
  As a system user
  I want to test the get approval tasks endpoint
  So that I can ensure proper functionality and data retrieval for approval tasks

  Background:
    Given I set up base URI for transactions
    When I set up request specification
      |HeaderName|HeaderValue|
      |Content-Type|application/json|
      |Accept|*/*|
      |Accept-Encoding|gzip,deflate, br|
