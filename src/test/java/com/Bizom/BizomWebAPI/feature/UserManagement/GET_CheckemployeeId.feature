Feature: Check Employee ID API Testing
  As a system user
  I want to test the check employee ID endpoint
  So that I can ensure proper functionality for checking employee ID in user management

  Background:
    Given I set up base URI for transactions
    When I set up request specification
      |HeaderName|HeaderValue|
      |Content-Type|application/json|
      |Accept|*/*|
      |Accept-Encoding|gzip,deflate, br|
      |Connection|keep-alive|

  Scenario: TC_01 Check employee ID without access token
    When I send the GET request to "users_checkemployeeid" endpoint
    Then I should see the response code as "200"
