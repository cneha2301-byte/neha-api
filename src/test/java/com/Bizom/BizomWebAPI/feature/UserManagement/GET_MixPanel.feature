Feature: Mix Panel API Testing
  As a system user
  I want to test the mix panel endpoint
  So that I can ensure proper functionality for mix panel integration in user management

  Background:
    Given I set up base URI for transactions
    When I set up request specification
      |HeaderName|HeaderValue|
      |Content-Type|application/json|
      |Accept|*/*|
      |Accept-Encoding|gzip,deflate, br|
      |Connection|keep-alive|
