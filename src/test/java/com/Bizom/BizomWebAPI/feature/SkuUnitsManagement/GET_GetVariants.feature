Feature: SKU Units Get Variants API Testing
  As a system user
  I want to test the skunits getvariants endpoint
  So that I can ensure proper functionality and data retrieval for variants management

  Background:
    Given I set up base URI for transactions
    When I set up request specification
      |HeaderName|HeaderValue|
      |Content-Type|application/json|
      |Accept|*/*|
